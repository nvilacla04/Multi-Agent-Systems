Exercise 4


1. The call of same_spieces(dog,A) will fail because
all of the clause that appear in the KB, and might be accesed by the call of same_spieces(dog,A),
consist of the not(X=Y).
After binding the dog = X and A = Y we have not(dog=A), where A is uninstantiated variable and dog is an instance.
Therefroe dog=A is valid, however not(sth) evaluates to true only if sth = false, thus in this case not(dog=A)
will evaluate to false. The same case happens in the last clause where not(X=Y) is chekced again.



2. If instead of calling same_spieces(dog,A), we would call same_spieces(dog,cat), 
then the call will become true. Call will find its possible answer in the forth clause, so that 
X = dog and Y = cat. Follwoing that wirst rule will evaluate to true
since in our case (dog = cat ) = False, and not(False) = True.
Then program will shif its focus towards the next rule - mammal(dog), and will start
looking through the KB to find it. It will find it in the first clause and thus evaluate to true.
The last rule to call is the mammal(cat), which also has its instance in the KB (2nd clause) and thus 
its call evaluates to true. Therefore the combination of this 3 trues will evaluate to true as well



4.  
mammal( dog ).
mammal( cat ).
bird( eagle ).
bird( parrot ).
same_species(X ,Y ) :- mammal(X), mammal(Y), not(X=Y)
same_species(X , Y ) :- bird(X), bird(Y), not(X=Y)

This KB wil improve the performance of the cals such as same_species(X,Y). 
This is the fact since it doesnt' immedietly fails by checking the not(X=Y) (as it happended with the intial KB)
With the updated KB and with the intial call same_species(dog,A) it first, bounds X = dog and then Y = A
it then checks if the mammal(dog) exsits in our KB - it does. then it check if mammal(A) exists.
The first that occurs is when A = dog, thus this evaluates to true as well. Finally it checks 
not(X=Y) which in our case is (dog = dog)  = True but not(True) = False thus it backtracks to the 
previous step and checks the if there is any other value that could boudn to A and satisfy mammal(sth).
There is a value cat, it bounds to A = cat, we have mammal(cat) = true , and then not(dog=cat) = true
