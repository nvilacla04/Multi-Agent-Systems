warm(Y):-warm(Y).
warm(a).
happy(b).
summer(X):-happy(X).
summer(X):-warm(Y).
*/


/*
explanation
if we place the clauses in the way given above (3,4,5,1,2)
and query our KB by summer(a) then after wfinidng a first fitting clause
4th from the top, X binds to a and it is true iff happy(a) exist in our KB -it doesnt thus
it evalautes to false and look for the other rule.
It finds rule nr 5 (strating from the top) which binds X with a and states that this is true if 
warm(Y) is true . It looks for this kind of infromation in our KB and finds the frist one
warm(Y) is true if warm(Y) is true, which leads to an infinfe loop cuz it kept looking for this 
variable Y that might make warm(Y) true.
